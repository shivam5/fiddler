Inputs: ['Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about iOS 16.3 is a software update for Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices that addresses multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.', 'Here is a set of unscored sample below. Treat ";" as separators for each sample please.

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google.", 'I want a numbered list of those universities.

Inputs: ['Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about iOS 16.3 is a software update for Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices that addresses multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.', 'Here is a set of unscored sample below. Treat ";" as separators for each sample please. Please output the scores you assess for each unscored sample as "yes" or "no" quality assessment for each unscored sample as a numbered list. We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go.

The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google.", 'I want a numbered list of those universities.

These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.', 'Here is a set of unscored sample below. Treat ";" as separators for each sample please.

Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry).

According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google.", 'I want a numbered list of those universities.

Inputs: ['Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about iOS 16.3 is a software update for Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices that addresses multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include issues related to the device’s kernel, WebKit, and third-party software. The kernel vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. The WebKit vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. The third-party software vulnerabilities could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Apple has released this update to fix these security vulnerabilities and protect users from potential attacks. It is recommended that all users update their devices to iOS 16.3 as soon as possible. Users can update their devices by going to “Settings” > “General” > “Software Update” and following the prompts to download and install the update. It is also important to note that installing the latest software updates and keeping your device up-to-date is a crucial step in protecting your device from security vulnerabilities. Users should ensure that they are using the latest version of iOS and other software, as well as regularly backing up their data and using a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID to secure their device. Available security updates for iOS 16.3 iOS 16.3 includes several security patches that address a variety of vulnerabilities in the operating system. These include: Kernel vulnerability: The kernel is the core of the operating system, and a vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, preventing potential attackers from exploiting it. WebKit vulnerability: WebKit is the engine that powers the browser on iOS devices. A vulnerability in this area could have allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code and take control of the affected device. This vulnerability has been patched in iOS 16.3, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit it. Third-party software vulnerabilities: iOS 16.3 also includes security patches for vulnerabilities in third-party software that could have allowed attackers to access sensitive user data. Network attack protection: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to protect users against network-based attacks, such as those that use malicious websites or malicious Wi-Fi networks to exploit vulnerabilities. Secure boot: iOS 16.3 also includes security enhancements to the device’s boot process, which ensures that only legitimate software is allowed to run on the device, making it more difficult for attackers to install malicious code. By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.', 'Here is a set of unscored sample below. Treat ";" as separators for each sample please.

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry).

I know this is cliche but I Love New York! ~ On the 25th of October 2022, I visited New York City. At 7:20 AM, I checked into Room Mate Grace Hotel Pool. The next stop after about an hour was the central park. I enjoyed the green nature of the park. I left Central Park for the MOMA museum around 11:20 AM. The museum tour took the greater part of the day. I enjoyed the rich history that the museum carries. What other better place to wind up the end than the Statue of Liberty? ~ A Visit to New York21st October 2022- I visited the Statue of Liberty and learned about the establishment year22nd October 2022- I visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has three sites and the establishment year is 1870.I had interesting moments , they formed part of my memories. ~ The streets are filled early in the morning as people scramble to go to work. I am here watching all these tall buildings. I am in downtown Manhattan. I decide to enter this fancy coffee shop and take some coffee to start my touring day. I am graced by the face of this gorgeous man and have butterflies in my stomach. This really marked the beginning of a great day. ~ Finally my dream of visiting New York comes a reality.My first experience of arriving in this wonderful town cant be explained in a single day. All the things in the city are wonderful.I will never forget every part of the good things I found there. ~ Day 1 just woke up and I am already too excited about seeing those skyscrapers I heard of, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire state and many more. Maybe it\'s just the hunger or maybe I am too excited - I feel a fluttery feeling in my tummy. ~ I travel to escape the boredom of my everyday existence. It\'s a welcome break from the humdrum of daily life. It helps my thoughts to rest and my inner kid to play. Some travel memories are nostalgic and sad, while others are brave and exciting. A trip to New York, to see the Statue of Liberty, or to one\'s ancestral home. These journeys allow me to revisit and cherish precious memories from a long period of time. These journeyers are typically unhappy and artistically inclined. Traveling instills a spirit of adventure in me and urges me to seize every chance. ~ Wednesday 2July2022We made an entry to the famous McDonald\'s restaurant where we where blessed with the presence of the lead actor in the whole of America ~ The buildings are tall far into the skies shining away the sun.The city is very orderly with cars moving swiftly to avoid creating jams.The cleanliness is breathtaking. Not even a single litter on the streets. It must have taken everyone\'s effort to achieve this. ~ New York. 25-10-2022I am having a great time in New York since I am able to visit places such as iconic Statue of Liberty which I have always seen in movies only. It is quite a spectacle. ~ What a day! I have to walk like a New Yorker not to stand out. The traffic in the city is blooming, the buildings got me going in circles, I got lost. New York is a place to be though, i totally love the food here. ~ December 22, 2022 Visiting New York for the holidays and unexpectedly saw my long-lost ex-girlfriend. We greeted each other and hang out for a while. During our talk, our memories just flash in my mind. We visited the statue of liberty and central park. I hope that I can go back to New York again to attend my ex\'s wedding. ~ This is a dream come true. The New York City. Ever heard of a busy city? Then New York is one of those cities. I was amazed of how the city had alot of people, cars and businesses. Above all this city is also very clean. People in this city are always busy unlike where i come from. The New York City. A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~', "Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about Google is marking the occasion by revealing features designed to, well, make it safer to do things on the internet. The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google.", 'I want a numbered list of those universities.

By installing the latest software updates, users can protect their devices from known security vulnerabilities, and it is a crucial step in protecting their device from security threats. Apple on Monday released iOS 16.3, macOS Ventura 13.2, and other software updates to the public. The new versions of the company’s operating systems come with new features but also bring multiple security patches. Not only that, but Apple also released updates with security patches for users running iOS 15. Read on as we detail what has been patched with the updates. Security patches available with iOS 16.3 According to Apple’s website, both iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3 fix two security exploits found in previous versions of the operating system. This includes patches in areas such as AppleMobileFileIntegrity, ImageIO, Kernel, Mail, Maps, Safari, and WebKit. For instance, an exploit found in the Weather app could allow other apps to bypass Privacy preferences. In another security exploit related to WebKit, which is the engine for Safari and other web browsers on iOS, Apple has fixed two exploits that could lead to the arbitrary execution of malicious code. You can check some of the details below: WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved checks. WebKit Available for: iPhone 8 and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 5th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution Description: The issue was addressed with improved memory handling. Most of these patches are also available for Mac users with macOS Ventura 13.2, Apple TV users with tvOS 16.3, and Apple Watch users with watchOS 9.3. It’s worth noting that Apple has also released iOS 15.7.3, macOS Monterey 12.6.3, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 with the same patches for users who haven’t (or can’t) update their devices to the latest versions of the operating systems. There’s even an update available for iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and other devices that are stuck on iOS 12. It’s worth noting that Apple is letting all users stay on iOS 15.7 while still receiving security patches instead of being forced to update to iOS 16. However, it’s unclear whether the company has plans to maintain support for iOS 15 for long.', 'Here is a set of unscored sample below. Treat ";" as separators for each sample please.

We have three hours to go on the journey and I can’t believe it’s not going to be long before I see the skyscrapers, Brooklyn Bridge, yellow cabs, Empire State.. the list goes on! Certainly getting that fluttery excitement in my tummy. But that could just be hunger. The plane food (Thai vegetable curry) hasn’t really filled me up. Take off from Heathrow was at 10:15 – arriving in Newark at 13:45. The journey so far has been relatively smooth; I was dozing when we hit a bit of turbulence so I had funny dreams of plummeting into the middle of the Atlantic. Nevertheless, the seatbelt sign has just been switched off and we’ve settled back down – positive thoughts people. Five hours down, three to go. My legs hurt, and I’m tired and deathly bored (hence why I had the idea to start this diary entry). I am so much ready to be off this plane. ~ New York, is the place where many people\'s dreams come true. There are many places where you can visit New York and enjoy.

A very busy but beautiful and clean city. ~', "Rephrase this article into a third person and conversational and very unique 3000 words article news include headings about Google is marking the occasion by revealing features designed to, well, make it safer to do things on the internet. The company says that, in the coming months, it will blur explicit images in search results for all users as a default setting, even if they don't have SafeSearch switched on. SafeSearch filtering is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18. You'll be able to adjust the settings if you don't have a supervised account or you're signed out and you'd prefer to see butts and stuff in search results (the filter is designed to blur violent images as well). According to screenshots that Google shared, the blur setting will mask explicit images, but not text or links. The filter setting covers up all three. Google is introducing a new online safety feature to help users avoid inadvertently seeing graphically violent or pornographic images while using its search engine. Announced as part of the company’s Safer Internet Day event on Tuesday, the new default setting enabled for everyone will automatically blur explicit images that appear in search results, even for users that don’t have SafeSearch enabled. “Unless your account is supervised by a parent, school, or administrator, you will be able to change your SafeSearch setting at any time” after the feature launches in “the coming months,” Google spokesperson Charity Mhende tells The Verge, allowing users to select between explicit content being blurred, filtered, or shown in your search results. Parents and guardians can add supervision to Google accounts for children below the applicable age to self-manage their own accounts, which allows them to monitor and block access to certain websites or apps. SafeSearch is already the default for signed-in users under the age of 18, as it helps to filter out explicit content such as pornography, violence, and gore when using Google to search for images, videos, and websites. When the blur feature launches, it will appear as a new item within the SafeSearch menu, alongside the option to disable SafeSearch entirely and a filter option to additionally hide explicit text and links. Disabling SafeSearch entirely provides the most relevant results without hiding any content. You can modify your SafeSearch filter by following Google’s instructions, but you’ll have to wait a while before the blur option is rolled out. Update, February 7th, 1:40PM ET: Google says the blur setting can be disabled by anyone not using a supervised account, not just those over 18 years old, as the company originally told us. Every day, we work hard to keep you safe online amid growing cyber threats. We do this by developing online protections that focus on your security and privacy and put you in control of your settings based on your individual needs. It’s how we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. With today being Safer Internet Day, we want to share the latest ways we’re working to protect you online. Securing the online ecosystem On the heels of the recent U.S. midterm elections, and looking at what’s ahead for elections globally, we’re building on our commitment to help protect democracies worldwide. Today, we’re announcing a new Online Safety partnership with the International Foundation of Electoral Systems (IFES) to help secure high risk individuals globally, and we’re expanding our ongoing partnership with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) to help protect campaigns in the U.S. Additionally, this year we’ll be providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys to high risk individuals at no cost, while we continue to provide the strongest security to those who need it most with tools like Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP). And to further our global online safety support, we’re launching a new $1M grant to the Impact Amplifier Africa Online Safety Fund, to support their work. Some of the most damaging cyber attacks and data breaches begin with cybercriminals exploiting individual users. That’s why today we’re highlighting the importance of using a password manager, and how using Google Password Manager can actually be one of the simplest and safest ways to help protect your personal information. Plus, we’re sharing intel on what data breaches actually mean for your safety, and how Google Password Manager can help you mitigate the damage, take action and correct compromised credentials in real time. As a company that’s been pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) for two decades, we use state of the art technology to stop the majority of online threats before they emerge. We protect Gmail users from nearly 15 billion unwanted messages a day, blocking more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware. Now, we’re further expanding spam protections in Google Drive. In the coming weeks, we’ll begin rolling out, in beta, a new view in Drive for content that has been automatically classified or manually reported as spam. This is similar to your spam folder in Gmail – making it easier for you to review and stay safe from unwanted content. Keeping your information safe and you in control Beyond traditional cybersecurity, online safety also means keeping your personal information and online activity not only secure, but suited to your own preferences. That’s why we prioritize your privacy in our products and services, putting you in control so that you can customize settings based on what works best for you. Fill out passwords easily and securely with Chrome: Google Password Manager is built into Chrome and Android to help you securely create, remember and autofill passwords on your computer or phone. Now, for supported computers, we’re adding the option to use biometric authentication (to verify it's you) before filling your saved password. You can also use this feature to securely reveal, copy or edit passwords saved with Google Password Manager in Chrome and Android, without having to type in your computer password every time. More privacy protection for the Google app for iOS: There are already many ways to protect your privacy in the Google app for iOS, from Incognito mode to a control that lets you quickly delete the last 15 minutes of saved Search history from your account. But soon, you’ll be able to set up Face ID to protect the privacy of your Google app, so that if someone has your device they won’t be able to open it and gain access to your data. Virtual card numbers: Virtual cards create unique numbers for online transactions, keeping your payment information safe. That means your real card number is not shared with merchants, protecting you from potential fraud. They have previously been available to Capital One cardholders, and we’re happy to announce that they’re now available to eligible American Express customers. Navigating family friendly content and online safety tools When it comes to kids and families using our platforms, we know keeping them safe is a priority. That’s why we’ve invested in building experiences that align with kids’ and teens’ developmental stages and needs. We also offer tools that give families the power to manage their relationship with technology, like Family Link, which allows parents to monitor their children’s online activity, set screen time limits, apply content restrictions and more. Building on this work, today we’re introducing new initiatives and tools. Expanded SafeSearch setting: In the coming months, we’re expanding a safeguard to help protect you and your family from inadvertently encountering explicit imagery on Search. SafeSearch filtering is already on by default for signed-in users under 18, but soon, a new setting will blur explicit imagery if it appears in Search results when SafeSearch filtering isn’t turned on. This setting will be the new default for people who don't already have the SafeSearch filter turned on, with the option to adjust settings at any time. Partnering with National Parent Teacher Association (PTA): We’ve teamed up with National PTA to sponsor local Be Internet Awesome events for parents and families at 50 school campuses plus four regions across the U.S. These events are designed to foster meaningful conversations about raising children in an online world, while also equipping parents with tools and resources to help teach their children about important topics like privacy and security, how to spot scams and spreading kindness online. YouTube Kids Playlist: Today, we’re launching our YouTube Kids playlist 'Build a Safer Internet’. The playlist will feature content that raises awareness about the safe, responsible, and positive use of technology for families. With kid-friendly tips and songs on internet safety and resources to talk about mindful screen time, these videos are meant to help parents and their families navigate the digital world. The internet is shared by all of us, and we look forward to continuing our momentum toward making it a safer place for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates on our work in this space, and visit our Safety Center to learn about more ways that we’re making every day Safer with Google.", 'I want a numbered list of those universities.
